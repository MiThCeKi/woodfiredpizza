This project is a service for pizza and bread making. 
The main functions are to predict temperature so I know when I can put in
a pizza, whether I'll need to add a piece of wood to maintain temperature, 
or what time I can expect to put in my bread. 

There will be a cloud based server that receives data from the pizza oven and 
takes requests to give me what I want to know.
